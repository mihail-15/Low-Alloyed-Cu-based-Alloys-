# Dataset of Mechanical Properties and Electrical Conductivity of Low-Alloyed Cu-based Alloys 

## Description
This dataset contains detailed information on the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of low-alloyed Cu-based alloys. The data contains over 180 rows of data, which were extracted from a larger set of Cu-based alloys by Gorsse, S.; Gouné, M.; Lin, W.-C.; Girard, L. Dataset of Mechanical Properties and Electrical Conductivity of Copper-Based Alloys.
